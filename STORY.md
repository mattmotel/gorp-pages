It's me, Jark Monsoon-your representative from the Galactic Order's Republic of
Print.
An organization Ive for sure heard of...
I've come from the Galactic Order to deliver GORp™ to you as the representative of all earthly beings.
We tried to give this to you during the Apollo missions, but you were busy pooping in a can in space. You had other priorities at the time such as—not dying in the vacuum of space.
Anyways, I have this typeface for you. It's required for use on Earth, as it is required elsewhere in all Galactic Municipalities.

Semblance and unity must be found throughout the galaxy! We don’t want to descend into absolute chaos, do we?

It appears I have discovered a very respectful and obedient Galactic Subject. You have been found to be a worthy suitor of GORP™

THERE IS RESISTANCE:

Case Mikeboltington IV

people's resistance opposing Gorp™

Hi! I’m Case Mikeboltington IV from the PROG™ also known as the People’s Resistance Opposing GORP™

I’m not some dumb jerk sitting around letting these galactic animals schlep their type by mandate. GORP™ is fine, but it’s notorious Aperol T. Spritz supporters like Jark Monsoon that make me sick!

What’s your problem with Aperol Spritz?

Colonel Aperol T. Spritz killed my family


It was the year 25,962 and my great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather was at the battle of the Wallington-Mart Parkington Lot when Colonel Aperol T. Sprit’z alligator “Deangelo Jarvislandry Khalid” slid out of his White Ford Bronco and took my grandfathers life.

Where is Wallington-Mart?

Florida.

Oh...our...Earth—Florida?

There isn’t a more terrifying place in the entire galaxy than the Wallington-Mart Parkington Lot in Tampa, Florida.

Yeah...that tracks.

Anyways...

Honestly...who knows?

Oh right! PROG™

I work with PROG™ who is obviously very anti-GORP. We believe in things like freedom and liberty and H-O-T-D-O-G-S.

H: Human
O: Oriented
T: Typefaces
D: Designed
O: Only for...
G: Graphic
S: Situations


PROG™ is designing a typeface for lovers of H-O-T-D-O-G-S. I could show you a glimpse of it, but it’s not ready for primetime yet.
